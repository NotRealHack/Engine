# Documentation for the game engine for NotRealHack

The purpose of this engine is to have a highly adaptible "allrounder" Engine which should be also lightweight too.
I made the experience of having games consuming almost every piece of cpu time, which I want to prevent here!

Hopefully this engine will work without a bigger problem^^
